/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strict user-ownership and secure access. It assumes all data
 * under `/users/{userId}` is private to that user, unless explicitly defined otherwise.
 * Data shape validation is minimized to allow for rapid prototyping and iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is primarily nested under the `/users/{userId}` collection, representing
 * user-specific data trees.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict User Ownership: All data under `/users/{userId}` is accessible only to the
 *   authenticated user with the matching UID.
 * - No User Listing: Listing the `/users` collection is explicitly denied for security reasons.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization:  Rules are structured to avoid costly `get()` calls
 *   by ensuring authorization information is directly available within the document.

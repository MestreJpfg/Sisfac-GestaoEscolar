/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the XLSX Viewer application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for XLSX upload sessions and their associated data. Each user can only access data associated with their own user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - User profiles are stored at `/users/{userId}`.
 * - XLSX upload sessions are stored at `/users/{userId}/uploadSessions/{uploadSessionId}`.
 * - XLSX data extracted from the files are stored at `/users/{userId}/uploadSessions/{uploadSessionId}/data/{dataId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.
 * - Listing other users' data is forbidden.
 * - Data is denormalized with `userId` and `uploadSessionId` fields to simplify security rules and avoid costly `get()` operations.
 * - All write operations are restricted to authenticated users.

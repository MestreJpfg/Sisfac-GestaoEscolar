/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Each user has full control over their own data (students and user profile).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile data (e.g., FCM tokens).  Each user document is named after the user's Firebase Auth UID.
 * - `/users/{userId}/students/{studentId}`: Stores student data associated with a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing the root `/students` collection is forbidden. The error message from NextJS indicates this is the source of the error. The fix is to restrict listing students to the subcollection.

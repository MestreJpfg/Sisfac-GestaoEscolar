/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student data. Each user can only access their own students.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user-specific data like FCM tokens.
 * - /users/{userId}/students/{studentId}: Stores student data associated with a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list students belonging to their own user ID.
 * - Users can only create, update, or delete students under their own user ID.
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.

/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the XLSX Viewer application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access data they own.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, providing clear data isolation. Uploaded files and extracted data are stored in separate subcollections under each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Users can only read and write their own files and extracted data.
 *  - List operations are restricted to the owning user for user-specific subcollections.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The data structure uses path-based ownership (nesting data under /users/{userId}) to avoid the need for `get()` calls in security rules. The userId is part of the path.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Private user data is stored in subcollections under /users/{userId}, ensuring that listing operations only expose data owned by the user.

/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for uploaded files and extracted data.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/uploadedFiles/{uploadedFileId}: Stores metadata about uploaded XLSX files.
 * - /users/{userId}/extractedData/{extractedDataId}: Stores the extracted data from uploaded XLSX files.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - No data shape validation is performed in this prototype, except for relational integrity on `create`.

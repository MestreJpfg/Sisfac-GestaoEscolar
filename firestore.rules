/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the escolar database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to the 'alunos' collection. Write access is prohibited to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of a single top-level collection: '/alunos/{alunoId}'.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read: The 'alunos' collection is readable by all users, including unauthenticated ones.
 * - No Writes: Creation, updating, and deletion of 'alunos' documents are explicitly denied.

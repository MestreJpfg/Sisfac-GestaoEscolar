/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset defines access control for the Firestore database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on a combination of public read access for the 'students' collection
 * and user-ownership for the 'users' collection.  Write access to the 'students' collection is not granted, resolving the
 * the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error reported from the client.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: A publicly readable collection containing student data. Write access is disallowed.
 * - /users/{userId}: A user-specific collection for storing user-related data. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students Collection: The 'students' collection is publicly readable (get, list), but write operations (create, update, delete) are explicitly denied.
 * - Users Collection: The 'users' collection follows an ownership model. Each user can only access their own document.
 * - No user listing is allowed.

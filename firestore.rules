/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the escolar database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to the 'alunos' collection
 * and restricts write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The primary data is stored in the '/alunos/{alunoId}' collection,
 * where each document represents a student's information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read access to the 'alunos' collection is open to all users, including
 *   unauthenticated users.
 * - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete student documents.
 * - No data validation is enforced during writes in this prototyping phase.

     * @principle Allows public reads, restricts writes to authenticated users.
